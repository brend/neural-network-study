# Neural Network Study

Learning about neural networks. 

This project follows a series on neural networks
on [The Coding Train](https://youtu.be/ntKn5TPHHAk?si=0DsBd9O9Rp-bqC-H).

## What does it do?

In its current form, this project uses a perceptron
to try and classify whether a point is above or below
a line that divides the screen.
